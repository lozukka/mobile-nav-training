Mobile navigation exercise

I decided that I need some training on mobile navigations. I built this very simple web page to train. 
First I will building the structure and make it functional, then add the pretty stuff. Maybe some animations too.

I watched this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YDWNz65iI
